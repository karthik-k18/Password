# Password

Password Length: The password should be at least 8 characters long. Character Diversity: The password should contain a mix of: Uppercase letters (A-Z) Lowercase letters (a-z) Numbers (0-9) Special characters (!, @, #, $, etc.)

Password Strength Scoring: Weak: Password length < 8 or lacks diversity Medium: Password length ≥ 8 and has some diversity Strong: Password length ≥ 12 and has good diversity Very Strong: Password length ≥ 16 and has excellent diversity Program Flow:

The user is prompted to enter a password. The program checks the password length and character diversity. Based on the checks, the program assigns a score to the password. The program displays the password strength score and a corresponding message (e.g., "Weak", "Medium", "Strong", or "Very Strong").

Methodology
Create sample passwords with varying levels of strength:

Weak (e.g., password123, admin)

Moderate (e.g., Admin@123)

Strong (e.g., D$7g#B2!vXz@2025)

Test passwords using at least two free online password strength checkers.

Capture results: Estimated strength, time to crack, and feedback.

Analyze why some passwords are stronger than others.
